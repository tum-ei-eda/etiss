/**
        @brief This class is the brige between RISCV architecture and gdbserver

        @details Gdbserver integrated in ETISS calls GDBCore to read/write registers via virtualStrruct
                         The index in mapRegister() should strictly follow the RISCV gdb tool defined register
                         order. Because gdbserver will send raw register data sequentially in strict order over
                         RSP ->TCP/IP ->RSP protocal

                         Check the order with gdb command:
                         $(gdb) info all-registers
                         which lists all registers supported and its order.

                         By default only general purpose register and instruction pointer are supported. Further
                         Special Function Register/Control and Status Register could be added manually. Meanwhile
                         virtualStruct in RISCVArch.cpp should be modified as well as well
