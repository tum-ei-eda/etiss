== Branching & Release Policy

We keep our repository simple and trunk-based.
This keeps the history linear, the main branch always deployable, and releases easy to reproduce from tags.

=== Main Branch
* The `master` branch always reflects the latest development state.
* All work happens on short-lived branches (`feature/...`, `fix/...`) and is merged back into `master` via pull requests.
* Direct pushes to `master` are not allowed.

=== Feature Branches
* Create a new branch off `master` for each contribution.
* Use a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/add-new-decoder` or `fix/memory-leak`.
* Keep branches short-lived and rebase regularly to reduce merge conflicts.

=== Releases
* We publish releases directly from `master`.
* Releases are marked with *annotated tags* using https://semver.org/[semantic versioning], e.g. `v0.11.0`.
* Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
git tag -a v0.11.0 -m "Release v0.11.0"
git push origin v0.11.0
----

=== Hotfixes
* Urgent fixes are applied directly on `master` and a new patch tag is created (e.g. `v0.11.1`).
