            @detail <pre>
                    to use this structure for an architecture it should be customized like this:
                            #pragma pack(push, 1) // important!
                            struct YOUR_CPU {
                                    ETISS_CPU cpu;

                                    etiss_uint32 your_registers[16];

                                    [...]

                            };
                            #pragma pack(pop) // undo changes
                    now any pointer to YOUR_CPU can be directly casted to EITSS_CPU and back [YOUR_CPU ycpu; ETISS_CPU *
       cpu = (ETISS_CPU *) &ycpu; YOUR_CPU * ycpuPtr = (YOUR_CPU *) cpu;] it is guaranteed that the cpu pointer passed
       to generated code or functions of a CPUArch implementation was allocated by that CPUArch and can therefore be
       casted without additional checks.
