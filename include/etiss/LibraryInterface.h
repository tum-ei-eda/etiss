        @detail it is neccessary to override all function of the same category. e.g. for plugins:
   countPlugins(),namePlugin(1),createPlugin(1),deletePlugin(1). isEmpty() uses countXXXXXX() functions to assess its
   return value and doesn't need to be implemented.

   etiss::LibraryInterface::openSharedLibrary to load the dynamic library
