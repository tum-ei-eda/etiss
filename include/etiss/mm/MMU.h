        @brief Modeling hardware memory management for virtual memory -> physical
        memory translation and protection. It is oriented for porting OS to ETISS.

        @detail Memory Management Unit is the key component to support OS. Modern
        architectures vote for TLB to speed up virtual memory address (vma) to physical
        memory address (pma) translation. Since vma to pma could easily become the
        bottleneck, it is assumed hardware managed TLB is adopted. As for software
        managed TLB (old design), MMU has to be modified accordingly.
