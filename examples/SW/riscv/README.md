# RISC-V Software Compilation

This file contains ctr0, linker script, Makefile (originally from plupino
project) for simple RISC-V software compilation

## Build
### Prerequisites
In order to compile riscv software, the following requirements has to be
met:

  - A RISC-V toolchain is required for cross-compiling.

### RISC-V test cases

By default, benchmark provisioned with ETISS in `../test_cases` will be
compiled. Binary code and elf file will be located at `build/`. Minimal
dependent source code in `cmake/` is linked against final executable,
such as default interrupt handlers and exception handlers.

To compile the SW:

	$ mkdir build && cd build
  # At EDA:
	$ cmake ..
  # Otherwise:
  $ cmake -DRISCV_ELF_GCC_PREFIX=path/to/toolchain -DRISCV_ELF_GCC_BASENAME=riscv64-unknown-elf ..
	$ make

### Instruction test software

In the folder `instr_tests/`, there are the test SWs which could be used
to test ISA model instruction by instruction. These SWs originates from
UCB and they cover integer, multiplication and compressed instructions.

 To compile instruction tests:

	$ (cd instr_tests; make all)

## More software in github

Softwares provided by pulpino project is also compatible with our model.

	$ git clone https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino.git

The software is located in ./pulpino/SW and they have their own cmake
compilation script (which does not work for now, modify it if in need.

# Building on Windows

Get a RISC-V toolchain. Recommended: https://www.sifive.com/boards (scroll down to toolchain downloads)

Get GNU Make for Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=X:\path\to\gmake\bin\make.exe ..
    cmake --build .
